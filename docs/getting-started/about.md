# About FlipClock.js

[[toc]]

### A brief history

In 2013, I was hired by a highly credited engineering school to develope and teach a modern cirriculum for their computer science department. I wrote FlipClock.js as tool to teach a 300 level students. The goal was to show demonstrate to students how to implement, build and distribute a library with first-class documentation all from Github. Since then, FlipClock.js has amassed thousands of Github stars, and used on presidential campaigns, and on thousands websites all over the world.

*Never did I intend on this library being used by thousands of people in dozens of languages around the world, let alone presidential campaigns, which used it to display real-time donations.*

### Why hasn't FlipClock.js been updated?

I actually have re-written the library from the ground up twice over the last several years. The branches are still on Github. Between the time of each release, the technology stack has changed dramatically, forcing major changes and technical debt. The first re-write was with modern ECMA script, then again for TypeScript. Each iteration refining the [core concepts](/getting-started/core-concepts.htm), and refining the architecture of the library. Alas, between each major re-write something has forced me to shelve this project, leaving things unfinished.

However, I never forgot about this project, and always wanted to make it what I though it should be. We start things when we are young, and as we make life changes, priorities and side projects get new meaning, which are forced to be shelved. That said, it is time to make library what it should have always been.

### What's next?

Version 1 has been a long bumpy road. But we are almost there. To keep the project current with modern trends, and maintain the stability, the project needs a proper changelog, semantic versioning, CI/CD pipeline to build and publish to NPM, unit tests, and all-new documentation. All of which should be updated in the repo, open to the community at large.

If anyone would like to contribute or become a mantainer, make an issue on Github.
