# About FlipClock.js

[[toc]]

### A brief history

In 2013, I was hired by a top engineering school to develop and teach a modern cirriculum for their computer science department. The goal was to demonstrate how to implement, build and distribute a library with first-class documentation all from Github. Since then, FlipClock.js has amassed thousands of Github stars, and used on presidential campaigns, and on countless websites all over the world.

Never did I intend on this library being used by thousands of people in dozens of languages around the world, let alone presidential campaigns, which used it to display real-time donations.

### Why hasn't FlipClock.js been updated?

I actually have re-written the library from the ground up three over the last several years. The branches are still on Github. Between the time of each release, the industry has changed dramatically, forcing major changes and technical debt. The first re-write was with modern ECMA script, then again for TypeScript, and a final time once a full understanding of the requirements was established.

However, I never forgot about this project, and always wanted to make it what I though it should be. We start things when we are young, and as we make life changes, priorities and side projects get new meaning, which are forced to be shelved. That said, it is time to make library what it should have always been. FlipClock has since become a bit of an exercise of "how good of a clock can I make?"

### What's next?

Version 1 has been a long bumpy road. But we are almost there. To keep the project current with modern trends, and maintain the stability, the project needs a proper changelog, semantic versioning, CI/CD pipeline to build and publish to NPM, unit tests, and all-new documentation. All of which should be updated in the repo, open to the community at large.

If anyone would like to contribute or become a mantainer, make an issue on Github.
