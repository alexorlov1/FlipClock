## FaceValue.$carryLength property

The carry length is carry over when the instance it copied. The minimum number of digits could be 5. But say the string had 7 digits, the minimum required would still be maintained, but the carry can take priority to ensure no face value ever shrinks in the total number of digits.

**Signature:**

```typescript
protected $carryLength: number;
```
