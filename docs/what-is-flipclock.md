# What is FlipClock.js?

FlipClock.js is an open source toolkit written in Typescript designed for building clocks, counters, scoreboards, flipboards and more. FlipClock.js aims to provide well-tested and reliable API's that are easy and straight forward to use. The codebase is well-documented and we strongly encourage community contribution and feedback.

::: tip
FlipClock.js is much more than a clock. It's a set of strongly typed reusable API's that are highly customizable.

## Why FlipClock.js?

I ask myself the same thing, "why spend so much time on a clock?" FlipClock.js is a years long passion project that has been re-written many times that started on jQuery, long before TypeScript.

It's the old old adage, write once to figure out the problem, write twice to solve it. In the case of FlipClock, it took much more than two times.

The truth is, FlipClock.js eventually became my way to explore a singular simple concept and do it the best I possibly can, without any shortcuts, without any runtime dependencies, with great docs, and learn as many things in the process.
